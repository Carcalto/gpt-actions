    "desc": "This allows GPT to use the `api.github.com` endpoint to traverse directories in a repository similar to how one would use the `ls` command. It also allows fetching of a given file's `download_url` to pass to the file reader if both actions are present on the same GPT.\n\nProviding an API key is optional when reading from public repos, but is required when reading from private ones. To create one for GPT to use, simply go to [the \"developer settings\" page](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and create a PAT with read-access to whatever you want GPT to be able to view.",
