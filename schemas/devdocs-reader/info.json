Simply provide it with the URL of the entry (e.g. \"https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/array/fill\") and it will attempt to use a GET request to read the raw HTML of said entry. This is a makeshift implementation because DevDocs provides no official API for reading from its website.\n\nOccasionally, this may return a `ResponseTooLargeError`, which is caused by the response having >100k characters. **This is a limitation of ChatGPT, not of DevDocs, and there's not much I can do about it sadly.**",
